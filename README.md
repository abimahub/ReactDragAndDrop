# @abimahub/reactappboilerplate *

A basic boilerplate for creating a react app, without using Create React App.

To use this template, input the terminal command:
##### @abimahub/reactappboilerplate my-app 
(where my-app is whatever name you want your app to be called.)
This will invoke the bin/start.js executable and create a new folder called my-app, containing copies of the package.json, webpack.config.js, src/ and will copy the gitignore from this repo. It will also install the dependencies in the my-app project.

*Had to change the name to publish to npm :-)

in new empty folder:
..*  npm init
..*  git init    
..*  npx @abimahub/reactappboilerplate my-app   ##where my-app is whatever you want to name your app
..*  cd my-app    ##to move into the new app
..*  npm start
..*  npm build  ## or npm run build
